# Shadow Lab 1

## Start the app in dev mode

Via Shadow CLJS CLI: 

```sh
npx shadow-cljs watch frontend
```

(see also `npx shadow-cljs node-repl`, `npx shadow-cljs browser-repl` (??))

For convenience there is also an NPM Script: 

```sh
npm run shadow-dev
```

## Start the DB

```sh
npm run json-server
```
